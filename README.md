# Emotion Classifier

A web app built with Python and Flask that can generate predictions based on user input. The emotions included are anger, fear, joy, love, sadness, and surprise. The model was trained with Twitter data obtained here:

Compared Na√Øve Bayes and SVM results using different vectorization techniques and parameters to find the best model; achieved 87% accuracy with SVM (Linear) using TF-IDF vectorization. Also built a CNN but did not achieve higher results on the validation and test set (83%).

I deployed the Flask app using a docker image hosted on Heroku, try it out!
